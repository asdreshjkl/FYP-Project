Muslim and non-Muslim folks. What are your thoughts on suicide?
It takes a lot of courage to end ur own life. We don't know what they went through to cause them to commit such an act. I'm not praising the act as something to be encouraged but I admire their courage. 
Those condemning the victims r bunch of low lives. 
"Depression is no joke. Get help, voice out, pour Ur heart out to whoever will listen n provide aid."
"Coming from an atheist with no in depth religious knowledge, suicide is considered taboo because it is an act of murder. Murdering yourself. And murder is an act of sin of the highest order, thus hell is the supposed consequence."
"While I don’t condone suicide, I believe suicide is ultimately a choice. A choice they chose. To end the suffering, to stop the pain, because they cannot find alternatives to better their mindset and improve their situation. And if you want my honest opinion, suicide is selfish and done impulsively."
"I’ve had friends, colleagues and relatives who have committed suicide, all of which are due financially related circumstances. It always begs the question, if you are desperate enough to even take your own life, why not channel that desperation to work harder, get paid more, save more money to ultimately be better? Why take the easy way out?"
"In a sense, their children and spouse often are the ones who actually end up in “hell”. Inheriting debt and growing up without a father/mother in the family."
"As a Muslim I do share the same belief that suicide = going to Hell, but that will NEVER JUSTIFY lacking empathy towards the person who has commited suicide and talk bad about it to other people. We muslims tend to forget that with Allah's mercy that person that commit suicide can go to heaven (I mean He's god, who are we to judge others if they go to heaven or hell). "
My understanding in regards to shutting down talk about suicide is because its really negative and people don't like such talk. 
I hope op can remain strong and continue to live on. virtual hugs
muslim and it's just sad to think someone ended their life
"That said, my personal thoughts on planned suicide are that for someone to overcome their instinct to survive must mean they insane or in deep shit. Impulsive suicides not so much."
"I just wanna say, what people say and think is not in your control, so why do you overthink this? It only make your depression worse."
"That is the belief I held too. But in every discussion I have or see on forums that involve a Muslim person, the first response is always with a judgment and saying suicide = hell. "
"That's the thing though, the stigma of people thinking even talking about it means it's bad. Sometimes, you have to ask to understand, but you never know when the answer you get is, “Suicide is bad, and you're going to hell if you kill yourself.”"
"I am in a good head space now. More than ever. My depression was affected because I was struggling at work and myself. I understand better now for me. So there's that.

And back then, I was a little upset at their reaction because of a lack of sympathy, and I was a little sad that the person lost their battle. 

I saw a video about someone who shot himself because he was bullied at school today. Public response to the incident (it was from the US) was far different from us Malaysian people, specifically Muslim folks."
"Assalamualaikum brother/sister. 

In Islam, committing suicide is a big sin. There is a hadith that says the person committed suicide will be punished according to the way that person committed suicide. For example, jumped from a high place, then punishment will be you will jump then resurrect, jump, resurrect,jump... 

Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever throws himself down from a mountain and kills himself will be throwing himself down in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever. Whoever drinks poison and kills himself will be sipping it in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever. Whoever kills himself with a piece of iron will have that iron in his hand, thrusting it into his belly in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari (5442) and Muslim (109)

Having said that, it is not permissible for us to state specifically that this particular person will enter Paradise or that particulat person will be in Hell except as informed by Allah SWT and Rasulullah saw. 

Now, I get that mental illness can affect your everday life. Sometimes it feels as though there is no way out. Also, it is not like you can just snap out of it like some people would think. I get it, its hard (personal experiende). 

However, it is best to understand that this is a result of syaitan playing with your mind. They want you to feel like you have lost hope, they want you to feel as though you have nowhere else to turn to. They overjoyed when you act and think exactly like how they wanted. Don't. Never ever lose hope in the mercy of Allah, He is the Most Merciful. 

The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No pain, hardship, sickness or grief befalls a believer, not even worry that befalls him, but some of his bad deeds will be expiated.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari (5642) and Muslim (2573)

It is a test Brother/Sister. Turn to Allah SWT. Us human, our natural instinct is to confide and talk about our problems and worries with another human being, with a  friend, family etc.  We want others to give us advice, to pity us to coddle us, to talk to us, to care for us. This is not wrong because it will definitely help. On the other hand we will feel greatly disappointed and angry when we find out that the person you thought you could seek help from, turned their back or couldnt get your pain. This was my mistake, I put my trust in others when as muslim our first instinct should be to complain and seek help from Allah SWT. He will not disappoint us in a way that another human has disappointed us. Afterall, if you try to get closer to Him, He will get even closer to you. 

When the servant comes close to Me (Allah) as far as span of hand, I come to him as far as a forearm; and when he comes to Me as far as a forearm, I come to him as far as the span of the outspread arms; and when he comes to walking, I come to him rushing.” (Bukhari).

Just to be fair, perhaps, people you tried to talk to didnt understand where youre coming from or thought it was not as serious. People can't read mind and gauge the severity of your issue. I'm sorry to hear that. Sometimes people do care but they didnt know how to say it or sometimes people are struggling with things surrounding themselves too and its hard to have an utmost empathy towards others struggles when they barely had any for themselves. Whatever the reason is, forgive them if you can no matter how long it will take. 

I know this is a long post and I do hope you reach this point. Whenever your mind is occupied with any suicidal thought, istighfar and seek protection from Allah SWT against syaitan. Know that the moment you conquer that thought, you will upset syaitans and emerge victorious. You can do this! Also it goes without saying, seek professional help. Government hospital provides a psychotherapy for as low as RM30 per session if im not mistaken. 

 I truly hope you will be successful in this world and hereafter =)"
"Non-muslim and agnostic here, imo many people look at these things very literally (i.e. suicide=the person is too weak) as a way to avoid talking about it in depth. Sadly I think in Malaysia, we are still not at the point where we are matured and open minded enough as a society to openly talk about the consequences of bad mental health. Till this day I still hear people saying things like ""it's all in your head, just suck it up and deal with it"", and overall exhibiting dismissal when it comes to topics like this. "
"For me, I am very non-judgemental towards when a person thinks enough is enough regarding to living their lives. Would the news of someone close to me ending their lives shock and sadden me? Yes, but I would not resort to despising them for choosing this path. In the end, we can't know for 100% what a person is going through in their mind, and if they were seriously in so much pain and agony for living their lives, and chose to end it, we as bystander has no rights to shun and shame them for what they do. "
"Of course, I do hope anyone who is suffering from suicidal tendencies can walk out of it and seek help from professionals and loved ones. Been there before and I am happy to say that I am currently in a much better headspace. "
Life may suck but you can do it. Stay strong.
"Suicide is a very sensitive topic. Every person, have a different threshold. Every person also been through and withstood different things. There's no one to one compare.

Being at my age, I've seen people that I once knew ended their lives for different reasons. Some over money, some over lover, some over unusual reasons and some unknown.

People might mock, staying alive needs much more courage, that they are cowards. Or people might say that's so stupid just work harder. These people, never have been in  other shoes who was in the problem and choose to end it.

For example, there was this girl. Who had a very strange illness. No idea what it is called. But she can fall asleep suddenly. And really very suddenly. We can have a meal together and she can fall face flat onto the table and sleep. She can cross the road half way and suddenly fall asleep and fall onto the ground. You might think it's weird or funny. But that had cause her endless problems. You can't even wake her up till some time later. It was so horrible she ended it.

There was this guy. A very kind person. Took care of others. He work hard and earns quite well. No bad habits. Life is good. A very chill person. One day he just jump and end it. He didn't do any investment or loan shark stuff. Nothing. Clean. Just like that.

A girl, gang raped. Trauma. Pregnant. Forced to give birth because killing off an unborn child is a sin. No money, no job. No one cares for her. No one to help. Even blame her for getting pregnant. She ended it.

Those were once my classmates. I didn't know them well but I felt the pain.

I wanted to end it once too. I know how it feels. How scary the world is.

Heaven? Hell? What a joke. What people need is care from others. People rely and believe such things cause it's convenient and easy. I say those are the weaklings. Blaming everything on *god test you* or *heaven's will*. Wake up. Take care of the people you love. You know what each religion teaches? To love and care for your family and friends. To do what you can for them. Even strangers. Not leave everything up to *god* or *heaven*. Those who did it are the real cowards cause they refused to sacrifice themselves in giving. Instead they push all the responsibilities to *god*.

Those who stand aside from close ones who needed help and trash talk, you're the one going to hell."
"Agnostic here. I think suicide is a sad thing. A selfish thing yes but whoever does so truly believes they have no other choice but to. Anyone who judges them for doing so are not good people in my book. 

Muslims and Catholics (and I’m pretty sure most if not all religions) equate suicide to murder. So they think hell is the automatic consequence. 

Personally, a lot of religion doesn’t make sense to me. Who wrote these rules and who are you to force them on anyone? Who are you to know what god or god(s) want? 

I also believe assisted suicide should be allowed so terminal patients can choose to die with dignity. Like abortion, this of course needs to be highly regulated. But it’s a human right. 

The majority of Malaysia is pretty backwards. It’s a lot of “you can’t do this or that cause omg HELL” but believers pick and choose which “sins” are ok. 

Suicide was JUST decriminalised weeks ago which is crazy. But then again Oral sex is still illegal so I guess it isn’t that crazy."
"Non here. Suicide is frowned upon in my community, at least from the older folks. Whenever someone in my circle (I count people a few degrees of separation away part of my greater circle) logouts from the game of life, social media is bound to have tons of posts about mental health awareness. Problem is, I've seen the same posts going round for at least ten years, and still the same thing happens. I am personally neutral on suicide. Death is part of life, at least to me, it very much is, and sometimes, people just want to sprint full speed ahead into its embrace rather than taking it slowly. It's of course sad for those who survive the victim, but sometimes it's not something anyone can stop. And the adamant avoidance of death talk only makes talking about it that much harder. Think about it, if a suicide victim wants to talk about death as a desperate attempt to save themselves, and the first thing you do is shut them down or play the toxic positivity card (e.g., Don't worry, stay positive) to 'pass the vibe check,' you don't have the right to be surprised or shocked if that person takes their own life.  


My opinion? Negativity is needed. At least vent it out. If someone tells you to be positive, shut them down or smack them in the face if possible. Save yourself first and foremost. If the people around you couldn't care less about your feelings or emotions, then I have one question for you. Why should you care about theirs?"
"Muslim here with a real life experience dealing with close family member who committed suicide.

He was suffering from undiagnosed mental health (said he heard noises, saw stuff, emotionally unstable). His wife and two primary school kids found him hanging by the ceiling fan...it left a lasting scar, because they've never been the same again after that. I was among the first at the scene, and I remembered hearing the makcik and pakcik saying 'oh straight to hell ticket', stuff like that. 

Imagine the wife and kids, hearing that their beloved husband/dad condemned for eternity.

I told the wife (my cousin) that it's not our job to decide who'll go to heaven/hell. God knows better than anyone of us, and He is the All Forgiving, the Ever-Loving, He'll know better, so we shouldn't worry too much...plus, it is known that Muslims who are mentally unfit will not be held accountable for their actions, simply because they don't have the ability to decide which is right or wrong..."
"Is it ok if the person committing it do it because he / she have been betrayed by parents multiple times to the extend of the parents denying/blocking ones rezeki, with the person betraying showing no remorse whatsoever.

On top of that he / she does not feel that they contribute anything to mankind. In fact bringing more harm than good.

:'("
"Muslim here. Personally, people who suicide to threaten other people is the one who goes to hell because it definitely ruins other people's life. For instance, imagine someone suicide because they have ill intention/grudges, which led to the person they hated the most unable to live their normal life because of being accused and pointed fingers at. 


 Meanwhile people who suicide because of pressures, mental health or any other problems will always be forgiven no matter what.


I think I don't need to explain much here because you can determine based on someone's intention."
"To me, this seems true at a glance but once I think it over.......

You can negotiate with life. Although tomorrow isn't certain we have a pretty good view of the tomorrow. You failed your exam? can still retake or do other things. Go to prison? you'll eventually smell freedom(most of the time). How scared are you to go to bed tonight? Tons of people are homeless. People who desperately need help in Africa are still alive. This life too hard? you can drop everything and move to a different part of the country. Many people do that. KFC regularly throw away their chicken after some time. **It's easy to stay alive**. To be obscenely rich? thats hard. Go to the moon? that's hard. To stay alive? nahhh

It doesnt take courage to ignore the call of the void. It's easy.

NSFL and probably unpopular opinion:

>!But to die? To step into an uncharted territory? step into the complete unknown?!<

>!I suggest you read the last words of prisoners, the last audio recording/transcript of a plane crash, or the last words of dying soldiers. There are multiple videos of Russian or Ukrainian soldiers out there begging for death. Hold your breath and feel the CO2 saturating in your body and resist the urge to breathe. Feel how terrifyingly certain death really is. The fear for the unknown. For someone to be so hopeless, death seems like a better option. For someone to risk being a cripple because of a failed hanging attempt, they must be so very desperate.!<

>!Imagine the modern soldiers or even the older ones like King Leonidas. 300 against significantly more than that. Supposedly, you can feel the vibration of the earth when the Persians march. A true no-win scenario. All 300 could have run, grab their family, and beg protection from Athens. So easy to live. But to believe something even on certain death? To charge death when most slow their step or turn their back against it?!<

>!I don't condone taking your life but I have to say that for people who choose death, i respect that decision. But please don't. Get help. and no, am not going to admire your bravery. I simply understood your choice.!<"
"they need treatment, suicide is not a solution, appreciate life that God gives you, be better everyday and help others."
"Non Muslim here, my grandma committed suicide when I was 16, at the time I was grieving very hard and thought she was an extremely selfish person.

Now I think she must have been struggling so much to even consider doing something like that, I don’t believe in heaven or hell and neither did she but to not have to suffer any more on this mortal plain must have been an extremely tough decision."
I know some people still believe suicide = stupidity because = confirmed go to hell and it feels awkward internally if they know the level of suicide ideation I have.
"Adult should be able to end their life with dignity, should they decide to, without causing physical harm to another person, property or surrounding. 

Assisted suicide, if legalized, should never be the first option offered by health professionals but should be available as last resort for those that seek it."
"As a Muslim, I used to think that suicide was a foolish act and a sure way to hell. But now, I have learned more about mental health and I can empathize with those who are suffering. I try my best to support them and look for signs of depression or mental health issues among my close friends and family. That’s what you do for your loved ones. Whether I still believe that suicide leads to hell is not the main issue anymore."
"its not judgement, you have to distinguish between a warning statement as the repercussion from one action and judgement against a person. It is similar to God’s warning to major sins like murder or adultery with someone’s wife. And the reasoning behind that warning involves values, for example what is your understanding or opinion on life and death?"
" In Chinese culture, there is a similar belief that when people do bad  things, their souls will become too heavy to reach heaven, and they will  fall to the 18th floor of hell. Each floor of hell is designed for  specific sins. For example, if you are prone to telling lies, you will  end up on a particular floor known as the ""Tongue Cutting Hell,"" where devils will repeatedly cut your tongue, and it will regrow, continuing  in a cycle until your sin is redeemed. 

Similarly, there is one floor of hell designed for those who have committed suicide, where the person is  forced to keep on committing suicide and resurrecting until the sin is  redeemed."
"Speaking in an Islamic Historical perspective, even back in the Abbasid Empire, they have one of if not the earliest mental health institutions , acknowledging that faith envelops the body, the mind and the soul.  
  Research on mental health was even conducted by Ibnu Sina (Avicenna in the West) and published in his books.  
  
Its just our backwards culture that just keep ruining everything and might as well use religion to enforce this fallacy"
"Agnostic. Dumping random thought popped few minutes later.

*A convincing leader is the one endured/suffered the same pain and know what their ""fellowship"" facing in challenges, to find convincing ways. It's ok if you lose the fight and lay back or something, but for sake (not your relatives) of fellow depressed, stay strong and hopefully a way for everyone. We're the gatekeeper of the ""worst"", losing is expected; but surviving would be helpful for ""fellow depressed community"", our kind. Sort of.*

Lazy to shorten & tidy up the sentences. So be it. Done dumping. (A ""doctor"" that experienced the pain, might be different than a doctor than procedurally treats; not that I say doctor should suffer, but the convincing part of it )

Edit:

Something like Mother Theresa or Mahatma Gandhi (or Robbin William?) that put themselves into it? Are they doctor or chosen one to do so?

Edit2:

Oh yeah, don't spread ""our kind""'s negativity out too often, not good to accidentally influenced/stress out the normal people. Just within ""depressed community"", maybe?"
"You are asking people who follow a old book on their believes and why can’t they change? 

That’s like saying pork is actually tasty and many people are having it why can’t they just keep an open mind?
The problem is the book, and people who are in power of influence to ensure it continues to do so. 
They will interpret it as they want to gain more power. See trouble regions in the Middle East and Central Asia. Even a prosperous Islamic state, say SA has harsh laws against it because yes, it’s against the Islamic faith. 

Suicide is a traumatising act. The one doing it usually have made up their mind and silently decide to end their suffering. But they can never 100% prevent collateral trauma on the living. Someone has to find their body. Someone has to receive the news and prepare for funeral. Someone has to live with the whys and shock. To me, it’s a sad yet selfish act. Some are feeling helpless and bleak with no future ahead e.g. sickness, financial troubles, social issues.
We should all try to be kinder to people around us and even strangers. We never know what struggle goes on when they go home. People we see that look “crazy” or “stuck up” or whatever, may have trouble at home behind closed doors or in their minds. Try to be kinder and understanding to each other."
"Christianity doesn’t explicitly mention suicide , but there are some verses that imply it is a sin cuz we’re God’s temple and killing ourselves is like destroying His spirit. Or the commandment “Thou shalt not kill” is point blank for all, including suicide. Before anyone downvotes me, it depends on how you interpret the Bible. You can choose to take the most condemning verses like I’ve hinted at or you can use more compassionate verses about hope and restoration. 

That said, I’m not the most religious and therefore 
,unlike my elders, will not use Bible verses to try to comfort ppl. Not only will it look like proselytism and doesn’t help, cuz my friends are mainly non-Christian too. 

Tldr, I believe mental health is a legit issue and suicide should be destigmatised. Most of the older generation of Christians are still like OP’s family and peers, unfortunately.  ??"
Syurga is overrated anyway
"I could tell that mental health awareness isn't really effective in Malaysia. Not sure about other races but the chinese community tends to blame the suicide person. I must say Clinical Depression is a real shit nowadays, and yet a lot of people still think that the younger generation is too weak to handle problems. And we ain't going too far on mental health issue, since we are religious country."
"Mereka yang menerakakan orang, akan dinerakakan sebab perbuatan itu syirik.

Keep that in mind the next time you subconsciously say things out of line."
Coz it makes even talking about having such thoughts harder coz you know how society views it. So you need to keep it to yourself and pretend to be fine
"Did y’all look at the statistic, 60% of msians suicide come frm people age 15-18, idk what kind of depressed shit they’ve been through but i do believe it’s not the depression that killed them, but how to deal with the depression."
"Dude using the Spartans as example, is way off. Fighting for your own survival is not and will not be the same as suicide. Same with death’s row inmates, both are different things."
"I'm a non-Muslim. When you ""decide"" to suicide, you don't really care whether you go to hell or heaven. However, from the religion's perspective (I believe most of them are the same), the final destination is hell.  


Lately, one of my family member attempted suicide. He keep nag about his harsh life, cruel reality, and betrayal from friends. Then he tried to look for knife in the kitchen, find a rope to hang himself, and etc. Other family members including me try to pursuade him. But that didn't really work out, he is stubborn, refuse to share with us his problem (Man, everytime he tell us, it just like 10% of the whole story, we have to guess the 90% what happened). He end up grumpy and plan to suicide everyday. We have no choice but send him to counselling and  psychiatric hospital. Doctor diagnosed he has severe depression. He refuse to believe he is ""sick"" and still receiving treatment now.  


If you have mental health problem, please share with your friends and family. If you feel shy to share with them, go for counselling service or call Befriend helpline. There will be stranger ready to lend you their ears. Only sharing with others can relief your problem. To be honest, when a few of my family members (me as well) heard about the suicide attempts, our reactions are like ""try to suicide huh? go die but don't other family along/ want die go die faster/ he want to suicide? doesn't looks like it, most of the time he seems to be fine"". I would say having such thoughts are one of the normal react. We neglected the fact that we should think from their perspective ""Why they want to suicide?"" and the mental health they suffered."
"As a converted Muslim I am learning a lot about the religion as I go and honestly this aspect is one that makes me sad. I have been researching on a project about mental health awareness myself and my fiance is surprisingly supporting about it, but there will always be people asking me to do my project / business designs in a 'more motivational light' instead of the current edgy emo style I am going for. They only want to hear the good and positive side of things and I want to challenge them with the taboo of ""Mental Health is very much real and valid, along with the bad days that comes with it"". I really hope that someday, these people will have a little bit more sense of empathy..."
It's a waste.
"i m a non

for me suicide is a NONO

please seek help and please dont suicide.

BUT i do believe that people should have the right for legal assisted suicide.

i really dislike extra religious people because most often than not, their empathy goes down below zero dipping into negative values whenever you are against their religion.

they treat you decent but when you tell them you're suicidal they shoot you down even further. with friends like these who needs enemies.

i advocate for suicide but only for medical reasons. if life is tough. fuck it man. stay alive and keep fighting. quit your job. if you're gonna die anyway, be hedonistic as fuck. nothing to lose right? enjoy life. some people actually find a reason to live this way"
"I think the world needs more empathy regardless of religion. I also think people need to practice kind words. From my understanding, the makciks when they say things like “tak takut ke masuk neraka” and being all vexed, they are discussing among themselves, as they have a right to, to process that information and their feelings about it. They probably knew the person, cared about them, and is upset that the person made this irreversible decision and on top of that, that decision have supposedly negative consequences even after death. It’s not that they are not empathising, it’s because they are upset and talking to each other to commisserate and remind each other about life.

At the same time, if they really cared for the person, they might converse again after initial shock and frustration, about how they miss this person, and be more kind to understanding what that person went through. You may or may not be privy to this discussion.

I agree though, muslim malaysians have a more close minded approach and fear of reproach when talking about their beliefs. However, I also find that it depends on certain people and in right contexts, it is ok to discuss freely and ask - as long as you are sincere and it’s the right situation.

I find that life is more exhausting the older I get because everything is not black and white, and in the end it’s a sea of grey nuances - figuring out these nuances while managing my own emotions and actions is its own kind of hell - I’m hoping one day to be calm in accepting this sea when I’m old."
"Non here. In some Taoism belief, if a person committed suicide, his/her soul will get stuck at the exact spot the suicide took place at, and the soul has to repeatedly committing the action like a loop until the day when he/she is supposed to die.

Cruel? Yes. But if someone is living in this world with minimal-to-no support, and constantly fall into a whirlpool of endless suffering, I can understand why he/she would want to end their life. It's equally cruel to exist in this world when there's pain and nothing to live for.

edit: spelling"
"I think it's a sad and unforgiving thing. The ""do you really want to go to hell"" stuff just pisses me off. No one takes it seriously. No mental health discussions. Nothing. People just say ""Wow stupid lah this person. Not afraid of hell, should have prayed more and have faith in God"""
"In Islam, anyone that died from suicide will eternally be tortured by how they killed themselves in hell. 

Source: Hadith, Tirmidhi:2636 and Sahih Bukhari:5778"
"As a Non-Muslim / agnostic I view suicide as unfortunate. I don’t believe the person who committed is going to hell at all. That said I don’t believe in hell (unless they’re rapists, paedophiles, serial killers lol) That’s just…. having zero empathy for the actual situation. As I get older I realised you never know what a person is going through. What goes through their minds and emotions when they’re alone. Everyone is struggling and not everyone is going to make it in this life or see this life through and that’s ok. You can only try and help a person so much but if they still feel their life is not worth living that’s on them. It’s important to have empathy and kindness in these situations and not judge a person for their mental health issues. Everyone has some mental health issue but it varies in severity and how everyone processes their trauma is also very different. Abuse in childhood is quite rampant, whether it be from a parent, caregiver, partner. 7 billion people on this earth, and some expect everyone to be built the same? 

That said, as an agnostic I have seen suicidal people redeem themselves through religion so I won’t rule out religion as being evil. But to exclaim “aren’t they afraid to go to hell?” Like bruhh, not everyone is religious? That holier than thou attitude is still shit."
True. It makes me wonder what drove them to such ends. I think the condemnation is just to absolve people of any guilt they have over the tragedy.
"The religion is probably the cause and root of the mental health issues for many people.


Imagine telling children about the horrors of hell. That trauma is just sick."
"Agreed. Catholic here, I believe that if a person commits suicide, God would forgive them. After all, they have been suffering in life, it is only fair that they find comfort in the afterlife."
"It may not be a judgement, but a statement of the repercussions like ""you'll go to hell you know"" is not an intelligent response if someone is confiding to you about suicidal thoughts."
"If the OP is muslim. You should know what is written in Al Quran, our rulings pertaining suicide. Fact is fact. Why sugarcoat something that is clear forbid by Allah SWT? Islam is not based on human emotions, it based on Al Quran, Hadis and Sunnah."
It is true from old people (older generation of Muslim) but I think time has changed. I have heard my Muslim friends talked about suicide since ages even none of them did the permanent solution to short term problem. They are brave because they did beat the demon and probably save love ones from suffering of losing them to suicidal act. Our world has change a lot too so mental health issues will be judge fairly in the near future even in Muslim society. Only older generation still find it a taboo. Thanks God
"Someone I knew but wasn't that close with ended his life one day out of the blue. 
He just checked into a hotel and overdosed leaving a good bye letter.

I do reflect on the times we briefly met and he totally seemed introverted normal. If he needed help I would have never known lest he spoke about it to my face. 

As a man of science and a believer in Jesus. It's a very complex thought process because while we know that suicide or intentional murder of life is very very bad, a scientific approach doesn't provide good answers to why it's very very bad. 

The crux of the issue is the lack of support, many Islamic preachers just shout about neraka this jahanam that etc etc, but they don't talk about the why. Many followers just repeat their preachers words so it gets nowhere. If you see other believes you can see a correlation to logic and reality, whereas I think many islamic preachers are stucked in the old ways. 

For all the talk, we as a species need to know why it is so, and how it can be addressed, and where did the teachings occur in the past. 

Ie - Jesus once said to cut off the part that causes you to sin, even if it's yo dick for sex addiction or whatnot.
Now we know his meaning is to address the sex addiction and it can be addressed thru counseling, therapy, etc etc. 2000 years ago the only therapy available to stop fucking around was machete."
"Buddhist here and I always tell ppl who have suicide thought to think twice as it will start a cycle they will only go deeper. Many ppl think suicide brings you to hell but to kill oneself, it starts a cycle of killing yourself (Literally). Your karma will push you to do it again and again with each life time increasing sever. You will be born with depression, mental illness and situations that will bring you to the single ending - killing yourself every life time you were reborn. How to end the cycle? Simple gain wisdom and practice mindfulness not to kill yourself this life time. Cease the cycle but it is harder then just talking abt it. Most of the time is your action that you sow that you are reaping. But nobody cares because human only sees this life time, then next life they will ask why this happens to me."
"I think the point here is, if it’s one of your kids/parents that commits suicide, would you be so sure to condemn them to hell? If you were there to see their struggles, if you were there to feel their desperation to stay alive, what would you have think ? Would you still feel that they deserves to be in hell, given that suicides must be their last resort to be free of the pains."
"The point here, we follow what was written. We muslim dont change the rules. Suicide = eternally condemned in hell. Its a sin for muslim to go against words of god."
"man what ever you been thru , i hope you okay , i can't promise you everthing gonna be okay but i wish the best of the best will happen to you but please stay alive for many many many years !"
"Not everyone has the same tolerance for mental health, the people that made that choice must've suffered a lot more than they can handle.

The people that said ""straight to hell"" to the victims lacks humanity and empathy, they should be the one that goes to hell.."
"Thats called being a sheep. Allah bagi akal untuk fikir, tu beza kita dengan binatang. 

In no way are we allowed to condemn someone to hell other than Allah even if the rule says suicide === neraka. The ruling wasnt even talking about mental health, it was talking about a soldier killing himself because of the pain of injury and wanting to die sooner. 

We don’t know until the day of judgement, ultimately, Allah will decide. Allah will look at your life and heart as a whole. 

Lacking empathy on your side isnt a good look to other people and to Allah. Islam teaches empathy no? Did the prophet condemn his non muslim uncle? Or did he love him till the end even though he never converted."
"It’s stupid that people think suicide is some kind of sin that sends you straight to hell lol.

These people deserve to go to hell for absolute lack of basic human sympathy."
"Non-muslim here. Regardless of religion and belief, I have a question for all those who think suicide is a selfish and cowardly act.

""Do any of you actually see the full picture of what a suicide victim was going through?""

More often than not, suicide victims keep the dark thoughts to themselves out of respect and care for others around them, because they don't want to see their loved ones hurt by their demons. They are so much braver than they look, valiantly fighting to get through every day better than before. The despair, the self-loathing, I've seen victims that come out alive in a suicide attempt, and yet get ridiculed to try again. Try and have some compassion.

I'm sorry if that came out very hard but I take mental health seriously. By opening your heart and being willing to listen to others, you can help save a life. I had friends in dark places during University, more often than not I was the first person they shared their feelings about, depression, suicide, the lots. It is those times when you have to drop all your judgemental feelings, be willing to listen and show that person you care about them, you love them, and you are willing to be there for them every step of the ordeal.

I'd like to add that religion is not inherently a bad thing, but religion does not give you a moral high ground or authority to be a f\*cking douchebag to others around you. Dead or alive.

Your words can hurt. Be careful of who you hate, it could be someone you love.

Life is tough, if you feel like there's no one that loves you for who you are, know that I love you. My DMs are open if you want to talk."
"Ex-Muslim here.

Suicide is a choice. And like any other choices, it shouldn't be made when someone is emotional. The person who chooses suicide should talk about it to a professional, and make right by family members, give away keys/password/heirlooms, and die the clean way. 

If I hear somebody killed themselves, yes, happened more than once in my circle, I just wish to myself that they've found some peace and nothing can hurt them now."
"Because most religious people are only superficially religious because of heaven and hell. They become religious only to be morally superior to others. Would the actions of those people be genuine if there were neither? Would they donate to charity if not to buy karma (or whatever equivalent) to enter heaven? Would they not kill themselves if not for the fear of hell?

To each his own, if the fear of hell can prevent someone from suicide then by all means. But that is their own method. When a person is going through so much that ending their life is the only way, the afterlife is the least of their worries. In fact, it would be a great relief to whatever they are going through. It's not our job to judge them for their actions, but to solve the root of the problem to prevent others from following suit, and the afterlife ain't helping.

Herodotus said, ""When life is so burdensome, death has become for man a sought-after refuge.""

Many people usually have anchors to not make them kill themselves but that isn't to say that the call of the void isn't tempting.

""They tell us that suicide is the greatest act of cowardice... that suicide is wrong; when it is quite obvious that there is nothing in the world to which every man has a more unassailable title than to his own life and person."" said Schopenhauer.

I think most of the older generation still see suicide as a taboo but thankfully there are many in the younger generation who are more open to talk about mental health and suicide. The fact that suicide has been decriminalised this year is also a step forward as it open doors to seeking professional help and that KKM is also starting to discuss about mental health is also a start.

The whole taboo and criminalisation of suicide thing just prevents people from getting help and in turn further encourages their suicide. Elders would just brush off the poor soul and tell them to suck it up which doesn't help, because they don't know how to talk about these things and want nothing more than to imagine it never existed. It's how they deal with mentally ill children or even sex, by sweeping everything under the rug as if it'll go away...ignoring or not knowing the signs or the call for help until it's too late. They'll just stand aside and watch. This creates a society where seeking help for suicide is seen as 'wrong, cowardly or even sinful' despite that not being the actual case.

When one's life is spiralling out of control, the only thing one has control of is how, when and where one will end it. Can we not even grant that suffering soul that last right? The right to die? Is it not a better alternative than to a living death?

As a food for thought, Is your life truly your own when it's end will affect others? Arthur Doyle wrote, ""Your life is not your own, keep your hands off it.""

If you do need help, do try and reach out to the befrienders KL."
"Tell those people they're not free from burden.

I recall that on Judgement Day, those who have been wronged can demand pahala from people who wronged them.

Talk cock some more, even worse if the one who died needed help but they didn't help."
"Yeah, I've always felt that God would forgive mentally ill people, they cannot think straight, it's not their fault."
"thats why i asked OP , what is his/her values on life and death.. suicide is forbidden in Islam and a muslim who has proper religious education knows this fact, even when he or she has suicidal thoughts, they themselves knows its a sin and the repercussions.. how about you, what is your understanding of life and death"
"I once discussed the suicide topic with my parents, as I expected they condemned this thought, and the topic will transited to the spiritual doctrine of Buddhism: suicide is sinful and he who committed suicide will loop the same painful suicidal move everyday, at the exact time of death in his afterlife, endlessly, for he is a sinner that being prevented from entering the transmigration as a punishment.

However, as a not-so-faithful Buddhist, I'm thinking differently. I mean, who can really put themselves in the other's shoes and 100% synchronize the struggles of the suicide person, then have the same faith as they originally are in a third person aspect? It might be a relief instead of punishment for him.

In fact, I'm actually thinking that the reason of a person who committed suicide being condemned, whether in ancient times or in modern days, is the stigmatization of the ruling class towards the victim's lack of contribution to the society, as manpower is always valuable, whether it's about a religion or a kingdom.

Through times the core of such belief may change, but it still shares the same core concept of how they condemned the younger generations of not working, not getting married and not giving birth, resulting in low production, low birth rate and low manpower, ignoring how fucked up the economy is.

On the other hand, I see the suicide cases of old folks are less condemned in an offensive way, but more of being mourned as a sorrowful incident, as they are not contributing and considered as a burden to the society."
"I always held the belief that Allah is the most loving and caring. I believe Allah would understand the struggle that the suicide people faces. Taking your own life for nothing is not something that normal people can do. This is also one of things I hate about most conservative muslims in Malaysia, thinking everything in religion is black and white. Allah is not a robot that only has a yes and no outputs. Ironically, most of these people support the suicide bomber where it is clearly wrong. At the end of the day, it is not up to us to give judgement on other people on what would happen to them in Akhirat."
"How cruel it is if there is truly a god who calls himself the merciful of the merciful sends those poor brokenhearted human beings to hell for even more suffering when they reason they choose to suicide is because because they can't bear the suffering of life.

Yet this same god rewards jannah for those who mati syahid (read suicide) and kills other people along with him/her."
"In Chinese culture, we believe that if a person suicide, that person will experience the moment of his/her suicide every day, same time, until he/she found a ""replacement"", or until his/her ""yang"" age, which he/she would have lived if they did take their own life. So, pain will not end if a person take their own life, it will only become worse.

Apart from that, what I always remind myself whenever i feel life is meaningless is that, give youself a chance. You'll never know how long you will live and there is at least a chance to experience happiness when you're alive. 

You might be in pain now, but who knows, there might be great happiness coming to you soon. Give yourself a chance."
"""Usaha dulu baru tawakal"" I had a friend who commited suicide years ago, no one dare to visit his grave. His family are ashamed and didnt even once visit it. As a friend who suffer the same problem as he is, i understood him and came to visit his grave every weekend to read yassin. Hoping that god will help him in the afterlife. I know what consequences for a muslim that commit suicide will face in the afterlife but i still pray, that god forgive him. No matter how futile it is, I know god is all forgiving. Only god knows what my friend and i went through."
"Nobody knows for sure what happens after death. 

All we can have is faith in what we believe in whether it be in a religion or no religion. 

Overall a lot of people are afraid to die and that fear drives them to the extreme in some sense. 

From a religious perspective, yes it is wrong but that's as far as it goes. 

Mentality we are different. There are multiple little things that happen to an individual that caused them to break down. Some are just dumb but some were torn apart by others. 

We'll need to see it on a case by case basis."
"Atheist.  
You cannot know what is/was going through someone's mind and something that maybe seem on the surface to be of o consequence. Suicide while depressed is a mental illness and we (society) should acknowledge that just because they're invisible mental health problems are still just as real as easy to see physical issues.  
The person who then tells traumatised family that the dead person is going to hell they're a special kind of evil ba\*\*erd."
"i have suicidal thought before here what i can share. honestly what kept me alive was religion, family, friends. it may varies depend on people what they need but the most important thing they need was support and care. also if you have this kind of thought please please please keep yourself busy and never spend your time alone. btw my opinion regarding this was people should be open talking about this so everyone can be aware to their surroundings. yes, for Muslim, the sin for suicide is going to hell but i hope people not to be judgmental towards them as when they do it they literally has lost their mind/faith. what we can do is please help them. 
*sorry for my bad english"
"Imagine this logic :

God is all loving but creates mentally ill person with suicidal tendencies.

God is all knowing so he knows this creation is going to gg.

God is all seeing so he sees this person kill himself.

God is all forgiving so he forgives this person for committing suicide.

Of course you cant question this logic because god works in mysterious ways lmao"
"Speaking purely from academic study on religions, banning suicide is just a band-aid solution because if heaven are so fantastical and earth is a living hell, why are we living on it?

Spend whatever time and money to do good stuffs to rack up the brownies points and hopefully it offset enough sin points for suicide from not being denied entry into heaven.

Of course this doesn't help individuals who are truly in need of help and this is where religions failed, which is why I said banning suicide is just a band-aid solution and do nothing further about it."
"because Op is starting to use his taught process and logical reasoning to decide on whether something is fact or false rather than just accepting it as a fact merely because it is written somewhere.

Humor me, if there is an all powerful god who calls himseld the merciful of the merciful, is the act of sending poor brokenhearted humans who can't stand life's suffering to eternal condemnation in hell an act of mercy?

Yet this same god rewards jannay for those who mati syahid (read suicide) and kills others along with him. This the the best mercy from the merciful of the merciful?"
It is a waste of resources
"I talked about Spartan because I talked about the Greek in my previous comment. So naturally, it came to mind. Not going to sit here for 2 hours crafting the perfect essay. Am mostly on Reddit while shitting or in the office. Even now I'm on the toilet.

But anyway, you missed the point. The point was how incredibly scary death is and some people still choose it. It's easy to live but hard to choose death. It's easy to say jumping off a building is easy but have you actually stood at the edge of a tall building? That rush of adrenaline that you feel because your brain thinks you're in danger. That trembles on your hand when you put one foot in the air. Not easy to die because your brain won't let you. We define death when the heart stops beating but the brain can survive seconds or even hours according to some research. That's your brain fighting for survival. They'll stop every single operation in your body before dying themselves. 

Some people risk their lives for their homeland knowing they might die, some people risk hell to stop their pain. 

and you wanna tell me you're brave because you went to work today? nahh.."
"U r not seeing the bigger picture here. The reward is always based on the person's intention. 

Suicide means u chosen to lose hope on god's merciful and refuse to see any other way.

Mati syahid person only thinks of the greater good for the community/world and still believe whatever happens to him/her (die or not die) is in god's mercy."
"Non-Muslim and a loose Buddhist here, whilst Buddhist view is against suicide because it is considered killing, I personally feels that suicide is a last resort a person turns to when they are completely helpless.

Not everyone has the will to keep going and on the contrary belief, what doesn't kill you doesn't make you stronger, it only makes you suffer. 

So instead of staying alive and continue suffering, some may choose to end it for good, and I respect that decision. 

Most people argue that it pains the other, but I argue that those who said so are very self-interest and do not take the suicide person's feeling into account.

I do no advocate suicide, but if it's the only choice left, then I won't stop anyone from doing that."
"true, its the local mentality that is shit, no empathy no support...only worthless teguran that is redundant and serves to satisfy the ego of the penegur."
"Your point being? You're typing this as if we, humans, are supposed to be perfect. If we were perfect, we'd be God ourselves. Or that we are mere sheeps, to rely on God 100% without having to move a finger. Takkan bulan jatuh ke riba lah.

Humans are created with the ability to think for themselves, that's what separate us from animals. With it comes free will AND consequences. We are neither puppets with God controlling each string nor robots with set programming. Each one of us are borned different, and NONE of us are made perfect. We have our own sets of flaws, which is why we need to rely on each other. As a community, we become stronger.

God gives us a set of rules as a guidance, suuuuure. But it's up to us to make it work. We ought to help each other, instead of fighting with one another. We see this one person struggling, we should be asking ourselves, what have we done to help, instead of pointing fingers."
"Muslim here. When I read this, the first thing I feel is sad and disappoint with my fellow muslims who responded like that. 

From what I know, the act of suicide is certainly considered a big sin in Islam, but that doesn't make it permissible for a muslim to brand a person who committed it (may we be protected from that) as one who will go to hellfire. 

It's better for us to use that energy to reflect on ourselves on what that person was experiencing that led to suicide, what can we do if anybody near us was having such thoughts, and how can we help them.

I have to admit, the awareness of mental health in our (muslim, especially conservative) community is still lacking, but I would like to say that at least, where I am at, we are progressing in that regard.

I would recommend a book titled PENAT by dr. Alizi Alias, an expert in organisational psychology, where he shares a lot of input regarding mental health in the adult life."
"I didn't intend to do that ![img](emote|t5_2qh8b|26554) hehe but seriously though, I hope you're in a good place. It's good to be able to cry, it means you're still in touch with your soul and are able to be honest and vulnerable with yourself. Take care."
"Maybe, I mean just maybe, they are trying to run away from Neraka

"Atheist turned Muslim here. 

Act of committing suicide should be normalized.  
It's their life, nobody has a say how it should be lived.  
I mean, we can't even be nice to our neighbour or donate % of our salary to the needy every month. Plus, even if are nice to our neighbours, or donate % of our salary every month, who are we to decide what others do with their life?  
Who are we to decide and force someone to live their shitty life?

Of course if we pretend that we care, even just a little bit, we might get likes on social media, your crush might even wanna go on a date with you.

At the end of the day it's just a pretentious cause, people pretending that they care.   
Like the sons or daughters who posts on their social media status that they wish their parents could live longer, but couldn't make the effort to go back and visit them.   
Want them to live longer, so that you can ignore them longer?"
"on the contrary, it is when i look at the bigger picture, i find the flaw. 

> Suicide means u chosen to lose hope on god's merciful and refuse to see any other way. 

And under what circumstance would a person choose to lose hope in god? When in desperate situation where he needs god the most and god wasn't there. 

Why would an all merciful god choose to stand back, watch and ''test'' the person in shadows when all the while the person is fighting his demons? Where was god when the person prayed? Don't give me the excuse that 'god was testing' because in the end it is written that everything would only happen with the permission of allah. Which means allah willed him to fail the test and suicide.

Also the term merciful of the merciful means the utmost merciful. There can never be a thing or an act of mercy that is higher than allah. However in this scenario, i can think of on act which is more merciful that the decree set by allah that all suiciders go to hell. The notion that suiciders would not go to hell is already more merciful than the current law set by allah.

> The reward is always based on the person's intention 

Then why does the rule of 'intention' doesn't apply to suicide? In is only written that you suicide, you get this punishment. No mention of the circumstances or the intention."
"This is not a knock on you, more to share knowledge as someone who has a daughter with depression in the past, and a young niece who sadly committed suicide last year. The act of committing suicide is not a question of cowardice nor courage. For many it is a largely a mental disease that tricks the mind into extreme mental pain. Most want the pain to end and not “life” to end but are in so much pain that ending their lives appear to them as the only solution. Treat it as the illness it is like any physical illness which requires care, support, medication and professional help. Imagine if you are beaten viciously everyday, at some point of time your mind will rationalise that killing yourself is the only escape. That’s commonly how a suicidal person feels."
"A Muslim (from Kelantan). Suicide is a sensitive topic (as said by the top commenter) and I think we should not judge people who committed suicide like that. I have to admit some of us respond that way. I, myself has had some suicidal thoughts, so I understand how do suicidal people feel.

In Islam, it is forbidden to commit suicide BUT we should not judge people who have suicidal thoughts or have committed suicide. I hope all Malay Muslims learn about this. 

To anyone of you who are suffering, Inshaa Allah it gets better and we'll go through this together, you are not alone. :) Get the help you needed, there's no shame in that.

And to all the religion haters out there, I hope you realize that there are suicidal religious people too, please mind your words."
An easy way out
My thoughts on suicide is… life goes on
"In my non-family:
- successful suicide is ok.
- unsuccessful suicide with no long term physical, damage gets you ostracised.
- unsuccessful suicide with long term physical, damage gets your name hated on, and you get ostracised.

So, if any of us is planning suicide, better get it perfect the first time. We are told this as kids."
"Ooh so edgy ![img](emote|t5_2qh8b|26554) I've been where you are now, I know what you're feeling and why you're doing this. Being bitter and resisting kindness will lead you nowhere. Get help."
"Imo suicide is an act out of sanity, so i'll just assume the any who did was one. And muslim who died by suicide still need to undergo the funeral rites (bath, funeral prayer, funeral) as suicide is only act of sin, not an apostasy."
"Normally I don't like the idea of religiously shaming someone for thinking about suicide. I generally am not fond of religion, lagi lagi when it's used to judge someone going through a bad time.

But in the case of suicide, often times we contemplate suicide not because of objective reality, but perceived reality. Our lives aren't that bad, but because of depression, or some other mental state, we're not able to perceive the good parts and we only see the bad and we feel hopeless.

In scenarios like that, whatever that makes you pause from committing the act is a good thing, even if it comes from religious guilt. Because it buys enough time for your brain chemicals to hopefully rebalance and realise that hey, maybe things aren't THAT bad."
"Very easy to talk about, seems like some trendy discussion topic especially amongst entitled rich/ white wash kids. But it takes a lot of balls to actually do it. People I knew who ended up taking their lives don't talk about it at all. It just happens"
"I come from an islamic background but I am not Malaysian, I am an arab. Our society mirrors the same beliefs about suicide. I primarily had two encounters with it, where two friend/acquaintances of mine committed suicide. The general discussions around their incidents were quite depressing in their own right. The first was a friend/mentor that used to teach me arabic calligraphy, a very talented person who battled sever depression for long years. Upon his passing, he made a public post asking god for forgiveness as he cannot take it anymore. And the responses in the comments were mostly negative and threatening. Seeing that as a kid who was going through depression was honestly disheartening. But the general attitude towards it has to do with the belief that suicide is a sign of lacking faith in god. It’s a deep misunderstanding of mental illness. In all honesty I still think that part of why he ended up doing it was because no one took his mental state seriously. Our societies are in dire need for education, especially around mental illness.
The other acquaintance is a trans woman whose passing was made a public announcement that even garnered international attention. Her decision to end her life was the result of transphobia and mental torture from her parents who tricked her into coming back to Saudi Arabia. You saw the same reaction only more severely due to her being trans. Mental illness is a real struggle…"
"A lot of these people ( the Allah God Yahweh ) has 0 sympathies especially towards people with mental health. They grew up with such low sympathy that they will ask you to pray for forgiveness. Some of my family members are like that. Just because they can manage their mental health doesn’t mean it works on other people. 

Take care of yourself. Talk to someone who understands. Stay away from toxic people. Best just get rid of social media. As someone who has mental health and actually found peace, I can say Fux Them All"
"Idk why Muslims and religious folks have to push so much hate and stigma againts suicide, seriously get off your  fucking high horse. Just be compassionate againts other human beings and less of a deliberate asshole."
">on the contrary, it is when i look at the bigger picture, i find the flaw.

because u are looking it in negative light only.  


>And under what circumstance would a person choose to lose hope in god? When in desperate situation where he needs god the most and god wasn't there.

From Quran: ""I am nearer than the veins in your throat"". Lose hope = not having a strong faith in god / iman lemah (its common in islam to have your iman spiraling downward and upward and downward again. Even the prophet says taubat/ dua to be forgiven hundreds times daily- and he wasn't even desperate lol ) so think again, what does a really desperate person should be doing and thinking?  


>Don't give me the excuse that 'god was testing' because in the end it is written that everything would only happen with the permission of allah. Which means allah willed him to fail the test and suicide.

Any person that have passed away, theres really nothing much to discuss, only the good deeds of that person to his/her circle. They have closed their journey here. and for the rest of us who are still here, in Allah's game (also quote from quran: Life is a game.)  We still have the privileged to chose whatever we want. and whatever it is that we chosen- be it good or bad-  that is also our test that we have chosen too. Being sad is not easy, being happy is also not easy.

&#x200B;

>i can think of on act which is more merciful that the decree set by allah that all suiciders go to hell. The notion that suiciders would not go to hell is already more merciful than the current law set by allah.

Sounds like you are more interested in making yourself god and creating your own religion, which is none of my business. I can only explain to you what ""Maha pengasih dan Maha penyayang/ Ar rahman, ar rahim "" means to me: When Allah give me shit, that is an honor to me cuz he knows i can handle it and learn from it. When Allah give me not-shit, that is a test to me to be grateful. And i am telling this as someone who is battling with depression all my life - I had the common type of depression where life fucks me up, and also adhd type depression, where i am biologically/genetically born fucked."
"Why suicide is haram , its because you are on earth to fulfil a purpose. And only until you fulfil that purpose you will die. Suicide disrupts that process. You die before you fulfil that purpose. God is so just that the time he meant for you to die, is meant to be sufficient for you to fulfil that purpose( you will be successful in this pursuit only if you follow gods way). Suicide means you have not yet reach your full potential. Hence you die in vain. And you fail. Wallahualam"
"As an agnostic, I think the belief that suicide = hell is because when you're religious and there's a promise of heaven, a place of what is essentially eternal ecstasy and fulfillment, believers might have believed in heaven to such an extent that they took the quicker route.

Then, probably because of a spike of suicides, religious figures at the time probably banned it by drilling into believers that suicide is hell.

Its tragic because the mental healthcare of our country could be so much better if not for the stigma and taboo."
Not the way out ... and pls some dun get back at me
"I am very late to the party. Muslim here. I've read a book called Night Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide by Kay Redfield Jamison. She's an American psychologist who suffers from bipolar disorder. It's a fascinating look on the psychology of suicide. 

Speaking as someone who is living with depression, I've had more than my fair share of suicidal thoughts. I am medicated and going to therapy, and is managing a lot better now. I hope that God will be merciful to people in my boat. 

This extends to another problem that most people here have voiced out: theodicy. Why would an all-Benevolent, All-Powerful, and All-Knowing God let people suffer (or face any evil)? Theists and non-theists have tried to answer this question for millennia, and none can say for certain what the answer is. 

The Qur'an says life is a test, but is the test fair if all the options lead to suffering or failure? I don't presume to know His Grand Design for humanity, but I hope His Mercy is infinitely greater than His Wrath."

">What people need is care from others.

They care. Well.. Enough to wag their finger at you. But not enough to actually put any deep thoughts and feelings into the matter. 

Suicidal care isn't for everyone. I get it. But their inability to get that they had no rights to talk shit about those affected.. God. Makes my blood boil. 

Shut up already."
"Muslim here. 

Going to hell is the reason why I didn’t do it. However, in Islam, we’re taught to understand the God’s rulings. 

What He meant by that?

In my interpretation, based on what happened in my life, you’re gonna go to hell if you don’t appreciate what has been given to you AND ruin what has been given to you. Insecurity is unavoidable so there are times where you don’t appreciate what has been given to you. 

BUT IT’s MORE ON HOW YOU REACT OR ACT WITH THOSE THOUGHTS.

This leads me to think that there must be something that I am missing out. The plan that He already made for me or wanted to me to take. 

Simply put, it is how you take it and I take that positively. Alhamdulillah, my mental health is getting better with the mindset that it’s going to get better, it’s just take some time but I’m gonna be patient and keep thriving. 

However, I don’t like it when people said, “oh my, he’s going to hell.” As a Muslim, we don’t know anything about that person and Allah’s judgement. 

What if by the end of his life, he asked for forgiveness? 

Again, this belief is for Muslims specifically. 

For non-Muslims who have suicidal thoughts and tendency, I believe you guys did not end yourself yet because there is something that you believe in. Whatever that is.

Give empathy. For whatever reason, never mock down those who are suicidal. Not everyone can handle things perfectly and who the hell wants to live a life where everything is meaningless and it would be better if they’re gone??

Lend a help, give love to everyone you will meet. You never know how it helps someone from killing themselves on that day."
"I'm a Buddhist. In Buddhism we dont say after suicide a person will go to hell, but we believe after suicide, every life you reborn, you will also suicide again.

People suicide for all sorts of reason, but the main one I believe is that, they cannot see any glimps of hope in front of them, no way out, trapped, nothing else to look forward. In another sense, suicide is the ultimate form of escapism from whatever issue one is facing.

Buddhist view is that, we are responsible for solving our own problem no matter how hard/diffcult with it. In the end we will need to face the consequences of whatever that caused us to be in that shit hole situation. Hence, if we decide to suicide (and not solve issue) we will need to come back to learn how to face it again. But suicide tendencies is so strong it will follow a person to the next life, and we might be stuck in a suicide loop life after life. In a way... I think is worst then Hell itself? 

So... we try to encourage people to seek help and get through life, not avoiding it.

Hope it makes sense. I'm in no way looking down on suicidal people. I know how it feels when sometimes we just wish to die.  Just sharing Buddhist view so other non-Budhdist friends can know one thing or two from this."
"I am a Muslim malay and a university lecturer. Throughout my teaching career, I have lost 4 students to suicide. And not once have I ever thought like that and it baffles me that some would just brush this aside with religion. Why? Why the need to say such things? If you really have nothing nice to say, s h u t  u p . If your nawaitu is not ikhlas, don’t even go and visit the grave. What for? For you to update your WhatsApp group? Pfffftt 

I had a student that was obviously dealing with a lot and one day, he came to see and asked me if I know where he can get help. Told him some of his options and even offered to take him there. Said he’ll think bout it. 

Boy oh boy, the next day, parents came to the school and scolded me. Told me to “jgn sibuk.” And that there’s nothing wrong with their son. The mom told me “dia mcmtu sbb x kuat sembahyang.” I was gobsmacked. 

Parents decided to pull the son out of our programme the following month. I have no idea where he is now but I pray everyday that he is better and has better support. 

Mental health should not be taken lightly. Just because you don’t understand the struggle or don’t agree with whatever, s h u t  u p . If you can help, great, if no, S H U T U P! That’s it."
"We need to read more into this data. You are right, i dont think 15-18 would be in those deep shit situation that no choice but suicide. Must be some media influence + lack of family love + lack of self mental heath care kind of situation."
"Christian boy here, suicide can lead to hell for eternity so don't go for suicide, seek for help, or go to paderi nearest church or the church that usually goes, tell everything, don't need to be shame when asking weird question or telling stories about past cuz paderi will hear everything"
"I believe those who keep trying to suicide but fail to do so is just wanting care and attention from other people (and or using suicide attempt as a coping mechanism).

Not that i'm shitting on this person ya. Like you say, he need to talk to someone to unload the burden from his mind."
"That whole you will go to hell thing is too simplistic when it comes to the topic of suicide. Granted, I've come to realize that some people just don't know any better and are that simple. It used to annoy me to hear this kind of stuff, I guess it still does but much lesser now because I know that suicide isn't simple. And if people reduce it to such simplicity of ""tak takut masuk neraka ke?"" then they don't know enough. I can try to say stuff like we aren't in their position and God is All-knowing and Merciful when it comes to these things. 

The best thing I can do is take part in conversations to make people feel less alone in what can be very black-and-white society so that less people will wanna leave this world because I know how that felt before."
"Muslim here. Not gonna lie, when I was 14, I was dealing bouts of depression. I was a bully victim in a certain uniquely named all boys school in Kedah and because of that I was a regular truant and a regular at the counseling office. 

I kid you not, when I expressed to her truthfully about being depressed and contemplating suicide, she just replied something along the line of, ""You can't do that, you'll go to hell."" Like bruh. Well, I eventually got passed it but definitely not because of the counseling teachers. I had a good circle of friends who supported me and a few teachers who were very understanding."
"People who are suicidal are mentally ill, and needs medical/professional help. I'm not saying mentally ill as in it's a bad thing, but it's actually very sad. I had a few friends who committed suicide, and I felt very sad. I'm not religious, and I didn't care about Heaven/Hell. First thing that came into my thoughts was how fortunate I am to be living peacefully, and I wished everyone else could be as peaceful and happy as I am.

Please seek help if you've ever had the thought of being suicidal. Always remember, death is not the end to all your problems, and it's actually a very selfish way of leaving. Think of all the people who care about you. Think about people who wished they could live longer, only to see you throw away a life like that."
"As someone who attempted suicide before, Let me tell you, people who commit suicide are anything BUT cowards. Death is, very painful. To be able to go through with that regardless of the pain and suffering, my god i can't even imagine how much emotional pain that person is in. That being said, as a hindu, we don't believe they go to hell. In fact, Hinduism accepts a person's right to end their life. However, it is not condoned/encouraged. Malaysian Indians (Hindus) in general are compassionate towards suicide victims. Most family and friends of the victim feel guilty that they didn't see the signs, and other firends will console them, saying somthing like, ""It was his/her time"", ""God loves him/her that's why he took them so soon"", ""It's his/her fate, nothing we could've done"" are common phrases. No one really gets angry at the victim but some people do get angry that the victim was selfish, didn't think about hurting the family etc. We do belive that the person becomes a ghost if they die before their natural time, and will wander around the earth until their natural time comes. In Hindu funerals, we recite prayers and mantras, asking the good spirits of the universe to guide that soul to the path of moksha, and bring them into Lord Shiva's Kingdom, Kailash. This is also why the Kailash Mountain range is one of the most sacred holy site for Hindus."
"here's what a lot of people miss. don't downvote me for this. listen to science.


selfpreservation is a critical, desperate function of a sane mind. it's why you won't make that jump. or why you hesitate.

people who commit suicide are in the disease process that overrides even this critical function. and by definition, they are not sane.


no sane person would hurt themselves. through executing this act, by default, you are not well. not even if you did it for attention. and by islam's standards, being mentally unsound releases you from any sin because you lack the capacity to weigh the consequences of your actions. telling a person living with severe depression that suicide brings you to hell is like telling an intellectually disabled person to put on their clothes properly.


people who disagree simply do not understand how depression works. they might even say they lived with it and still chose life — this only implies their disease wasn't this severe to begin with. a lot of people still think of depression as being sad but even i have run out of words to help others understand. people can explain things for you but nobody can understand it for you.


you may think ""oh if you commit suicide you won't go to hell"" and that's exactly what i'm saying. if i asked you to go and try it, you won't do it. because you are healthy and you know life is worth living and you do not wanna die. see, you cannot fake this kind of thing. just the actual act of hurting yourself is against normal function. 


as to why islam says it is a sin to commit suicide, i don't know what to tell you. you want god to say it's okay ? because it's not. we are supposed to value life. but you are sick and literally physically mentally incapable of seeing this value (no matter how many yassin you read or how many rakaat you perform, might i add) and therefore you need help. we are not supposed to use islam to criticise and judge others, we are supposed to be a community. 


i tried my best to explain. if you think suicidal people are capable of listening to reason, and then get angry when they cannot, you yourself lack the understanding of this disease. there is a threshold where a feeling of defeat differs from being completely hopeless caused by a cascade of missing or a lack of chemicals in the brain (among other things).


TLDR; it is an illness, like pneumonia, like gastritis, like the flu. it may not have an IV treatment for a cure or an antibiotic, but it is an illness with visible signs and indicative, conclusive lab tests. it is not ""being sad"" or a state of mind.


by the way, if god willed it, even the devil can be in heaven. heaven and hell are destinations that *NONE* of us have authority over except Him."

"idk many things(or choices) lead to such a state of mind. but the final choice will alway be urs to choose. and thus its ur responsibility to choose where u end up in. 

imagine going above the speed limit. its not like u duno there is no spit limit. u see signs scattered all over. if thats not enuf. god sends someone to tell u. yet u still choose to speed. then u lost control n ur cars a wrek. some will come laughing some will come cursing. serves u right isnt it? but then theres some that will come to help. are u deserving of this help? were u not selfish of all the warnings n signs?

now look back into suicide. the aftermath. the distruction of emotions n severed ties. are u deserving of heaven? sure god is most forgiving most merciful. but ur sins is prolly not with god but to the ones u left behind. dont forget the clean up crew. 

ur sins with god, god can forgive. ur wrong to others will drag u to hell if not forgiven by them."
"I personally think that if you decided that you want to off yourself/suicide,it's your choice on what you want to answer to the creator .

You know what maybe take 1 bad guys with you while you at it,I mean you are not afraid to take your own life ,what's wrong with taking bad guys life while you taking your life 

 Go find 1 bad people ,take them with you ,I'm sure it's a more noble way to go than doing it alone"
I'm suicidal to the point I've been browsing suicide forums. I've been bought the salt I need to deprive my brain of oxygen and die. I'm just waiting for the moment my urge to die surpasses my will to live.
"My two cents as a not-so-religious Muslim, if people keep approaching suicide from the guilt-tripping corner, nothing's gonna get better. 

The makcik/ pakcik bawangs do tend to blurt out things they're raised with, including what their parents and grandparents used to say in conversations among themselves. I believe that they don't even feel anything when they say ""tak takut neraka ke?"" to suicidal people. They just say it mindlessly. Good for them, they don't have to face the modern rat race like the younger generation. They can never put themselves in the other party's shoes, they aren't prepared to accept to think that critically, and some of them are even scarce of education. 

My way of surviving? I just hear them without listening. Like radio rosak. Them being disrespectful does nothing more than putting them in a lower position than people who keep silent. Yes, silence over bull$hit. If you find your loved ones having troubles, help them. That's your part as a human. A person's suicidal ideation is between them and God. And God is merciful and just, He is not unreasonably cruel to His own creations."
"Muslim and a person who has attempted before. 

The only thing I can really say is that I respect all those who either survived their attempt or passed from it. You don't choose to be like this. Some people are able to bounce back, and some just aren't able to. 

I've been on both sides, I had friends who attempted, and also had friends who helped me after I attempted. I'm forever grateful for that. 

 There's only so much you can do when you're ostracised and or isolated. Keep those close to you closer and show your love in any way you can."
Sorry I only read upto the part where she said that person would go to hell… what a horrible thing to say. Some people are so out of touch and old school thinking. I hope our new generation actually has empathy and common sense :)
">Why would an all-Benevolent, All-Powerful, and All-Knowing God let people suffer (or face any evil)? 

i believe because human are designed with only capability to learn within polar opposites, infact the whole existence has opposites on anything - Physical & Spiritual, light and dark, high and low, cool & hot, big & small, etc. Hence all human at some point  have to understand about pain & suffering to acknowledge what is pleasure & reward. 

And since we're in the topic about depression - ofcourse some will endure it the hardest but that doesn't mean Allah is not fair. cuz it is only SEEM not fair from human's perspective - plus, we can never truly measure what's someone's limit is. Only Allah knows right? This remind me of someone (can't really recall who, maybe a prophet's' friend or a famous writer), he said something like - When Allah gives me pain/hardship, i take it with honor and trust Allah knows I am capable of bearing it and wants to lift me higher. This also aligned with Quran verse: “Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear…”"
"Muslims have zero empathy when it comes to their religion. Didn't use their brain, only Quran. If Quran said killing is halal then you'll be seeing rampant murders everywhere. ??"
"That is very black and white. You and I are old enough to know that life is not split exactly into two halves. 

Of course depression is seen as unfair from the human perspective. Human perspective is the only perspective that we have. I don't know about the badge of honour thing. It sounds like we're glorifying martyrdom too much and belittling some people for being unable to bear that 'badge of honour'. 

What good is honour in the face of unrelenting mental pain? To feel as if your soul is drowning and there's nothing we can do except bear it until we're released by death. If depression is honourable, people would pray to God to be depressed. But people don't. Frankly, I don't think people should go around telling depressed or suicidal people how honoured they are by God."
">That is very black and white. You and I are old enough to know that life is not split exactly into two halves

I don't meant it as black and white, that's why i said ""Within opposites"" and can only using metaphors in what has been existed. Even Quran way of communicating are mostly metaphors/analogy.  


> If depression is honourable, people would pray to God to be depressed. But people don't. Frankly, I don't think people should go around telling depressed or suicidal people how honoured they are by God.

No. Don't take my word and only processing half the point and turn it as if I am romanticising it. The honor is only truly an honor once u overcome it and gained something valuable from it. Some things in this world are not meant to be delivered by words, sounds, advise, etc. It's if u know, u know.  


>What good is honour in the face of unrelenting mental pain? To feel as if your soul is drowning and there's nothing we can do except bear it until we're released by death.

Your soul is not meant for drowning. It only for now seems like there's nothing u can do about it. Stay afloat, don't lose hope. You will find your answer."
"My thoughts are that it's the easy way out of life, making all the people that love and care for you grieve unnecessarily"
"their own choice, we all know humans are not built for the modern world (which seriously sucks)

but instead of suicide y dont just go back and live in forest lah bodoh, you dont see cavemen suicide very often right"
"Depression and suicide is not just a suck it up and man up thing. It's a real illness itself, much of it related to the hormones, estrogen and progesterone released. Hence why medication is often prescribed for serious cases.
Imo if you think about it, this mental pain leading to suicide can be worse than a death from illness or accident for example, because it also affects your afterlife if you believe that you will go to hell for it. It's a slow pain, which indirectly leads you to hell."
"it is mental health issue, only stupids will associate it with going to hell"
"Simply a case of, if you ask someone who doesn't know shit about a certain issue, they'll spew bullshit about the issue

For context, I'm a muslim, and a registered patient with scheduled sessions with a psychologist, diagnosed with MDD. I have a set of visible scars on both my forearms from cutting myself

Here's a list of things I learned the hard way

1. Don't ask people who doesn't know shit about a certain topic, unless they are the rare ones who are wise enough to say ""I don't know"" when they don't know. They'll say things that will make everything WORSE

2. The concept of ""suicide is an unforgivable sin"" is actually useful, and it kept me from destroying myself any worse than I did. My psychologist (chinese) also acknowledged that my religion helped me a lot in controlling myself. It only becomes bad when you ignore point number 1

3. There is no sin in things that you cannot control. Namely, your thoughts, and your emotions. You are judged only if you act upon them. People saying that ""You're a bad person for thinking like that"" have no idea what they are talking about. If you keep asking them for proof to back-up what they say, they'll 100% get stumped and either admit their mistake, or insist that they are right without being able to give a good reasoning for what they said

Keep doing your best to heal, avoid & ignore fools who talk out of their ass, and as muslims, learn the true ways of Islam from it's sources to differentiate imposter ustaz with real ustaz. I got my life back together, and am now the breadwinner of my family (just my wife and me tho) as a software engineer. I'm glad I never ended my life, since I got the chance to be where I am now

All the best for your future

tldr: avoid & ignore fools who talk out of their ass, even if it's family or ustaz"
"oh, also, just to be clear

Suicide is wrong, since taking human life is wrong. But, having suicidal thoughts is okay. Feel them, and let them pass. It's part of life. Whatever thought/emotion we have, don't judge them

Just, keep acting in a way that you know to be the correct way, that aligns with your values in life. You don't have to let your feelings affect your decisions and actions"
"> From Quran: ""I am nearer than the veins in your throat"". 

Verses can say one thing, but what follows is what can be observed. A person with crippling depression can feel his own heart. Its heartbeat and probably pain that stems from the heart and when he has high bp he can feel the pressure in the jugular vein but yet can hardly feel allah's presence/comfort. He say he is nearer than jugular veins but what is being observed is the opposite. Is allah more inferior than your own jugular vein/heart?

What i am gonna present you is the toxic loop of a religious person with depression. He read comforting verses like the above and also verses that say whatever ill fortunate event that befell you is your own doing. Thus his conclusion is 'I am not pious enough therefore i need to pray harder to increase my iman'. So he end up being even more religious than before. Yet when it still doesn't get better, he continue to beat himself up saying it is his own fault because he can never put the blame on allah. And there goes this toxic loop.

> Any person that have passed away, theres really nothing much to discuss 

Really? So what about those verses that other reditors quote that clearly say those who suicide will be punished in an endless loop where they will kill themselves with the same method over and over again? 

> Sounds like you are more interested in making yourself god and creating your own religion, which is none of my business.  

I think it is pointless to use this trump card to deflect any questions. But was my question really one that is stem of arrogance? Maybe i am really questioning and hoping for an answer? I am sure even pious muslims themselves have asked this question before. So my question stands. I can't call myself to be the strongest of the strong but yet have another person who lifts more weights than me.

&#x200B;

I am sorry you have suffered from depression. I too have suffered as well but I found out about my cause. It was religion. But that's me. If you managed to find comfort in your religion then more power to you and i only wish you well."
"I remember a few years back during Raya shopping, my family walked past a Kate Spade shop. In the front, a memorial. This was just a few days after the news of her suicide. 

My aunt (an extremely educated, religious woman, went to the UK to study, has multiple doctorates, SUPPOSEDLY well versed in psychology) opened her mouth to speak. What came out was: ""Bodohlah Kate Spade bunuh diri. Tapi bagus jugak kot, sebab ada sale"" 

My sister and I were stunned into silence. All that left my lips was ""Thats really fucked up."" but I don't think she heard me. 

Suicide and mental illness is not just seen as taboo but its almost antagonised to a certain extent in this country. At times where you feel misunderstood or villainised for your mental illness, just try to be thankful that your path has led you to kindness, while theirs has led them to hate."
"I against suicide but not because “going to hell” or “coward”... let's just say... I think it's a waste

Also, thoughts of suicide is different for different reason... there's a person commit suicide because his mom don't let her play phone, for this reason, I think nah, I'll encourage him instead...

If a person got cancer, bankrupt or whatever legit reason,  I won't despise them although I'm not into suicidal thought"
"I also once have the tendency to think about how death will be the best opt for me. I was working in a retail store, nothing is bothering me. Coworker are fun to work with, I have a few issues with my family(everyone does, rich or poor). A few insecurities about myself. But all if fine.

I guess the thought came when I am in constant schedule of day to night working every week. Every morning I woke up to go to work and thought. ""Mati lagi bagus lah"". You can only imagine my thought process for the whole day working like that. It feels like torture, mentally I was very exhausted. But I didn't tell anyone about it. I pray 5 times a day, there are a lot of time I missed it but I do encourage myself to qada' all of it from time to time. 

One day I got into accident on my way to work. Scrap my hands real good on those stupid tars. My my head feels awfully in pain and stress. But I get up immediately and lie down the side of the road. The pain was unbearable. I feel like dying at this point. All and all. I call for work and told them about my condition. I've been given a week of rest and I took it all like a champ, the pain, the frustation, the anger. 

During this time, I rest like a bear and play like a tiger.  It boost my spirit and feel better than before i got into accident. It turns out I just need a good rest for me and my inner self. I also do find time to qada my solat(not all of them, but I tried, still encourage to ganti all. Hahaha??). I quit my job as retailers and find another job that doesn't demand 10 hours of work. Get less pay but at least I have time for myself. 

Maybe it's different for you to find peace in your life. But I got one from having an accident, a painful experience at that. My hands can still feel the pain of exposed dermis to the air.

I'm not saying go get yourself into accident. But sometimes we just need to have a good look on our pitiful self and indulge in those struggle, it's okay to accept it and it's also okay to run from it(quit job, do different things) or maybe just scream back to your boss, lol so he could at least grasp that you're frustrated and need consult. The boss is human too, don't be to stiff or they will play you like a fiddle"
"So you are saying you want to suicide because work is stressful? Dont let your asshole boss win. You either scold back at him and get fired, change job, or have some depression which leads to your suicide. Your choice. 1 makes people around you grief and your boss happy. im definitely not recommending that option to you."
"That is just narcissistic. I'd definitely encourage him too. 

Every life is precious. Whether someone died from suicide, or cancer, or a that plane crash. My heart breaks for them and their family."
"That was just a bad joke. I wasn't entirely serious. Saying it with a deadpan. Like, “I'd rather shoot myself in the leg rather than have children,” or “I'd eat dirt than go back together with my ex.”

I tend to say things unfiltered to friends whom I am very comfortable with too. She could just laugh it out. I know she was, too, joking along with me. She laughed but with the following comment, “masuk neraka.” 

I didn't react badly at the time, nor that I am now or ever. She's a good friend. But I was thinking, now and then, damn, if someone has a serious conversation with her and wants her advice and that was her first response, whether she tried to make it light of the serious conversation.

Another, my depression wasn't entirely about work. Work just added it, sometimes. Most of the time I was happy. Even when there are no issues at all at work or in life, the depression is still with me. I can open my eyes one morning and the first thing I feel is dread, fear, and anxiety even when I was happy the day before or weeks before. One time, I had a panic attack in the middle of the night for no apparent reason. 

I wish choosing is easy. I didn't choose to feel like this. But I get to choose where I want to work now. Of course, I quit my job and found one that was less stressful than the previous one."
"I see. I understand you a lil better now. I can relate the part about 'toxic loop of a religious person'. I've been there - I was so frustrated with god that didn't mind insulting him everyday and I grew up with a religious family who has taught me about all the levels in islamic knowlegde: syariah, tarekat, hakikat, makrifat. Makrifat being the highest as Allah has 'introduced' himself to you - similar of this is that story of Prophet Musa literally asking Allah to be seen by him, and his dua is granted. Did we hear anything else after that? not really (I'll explain later).

What u are looking and hoping for are only limited to what a human body and soul can think/dream, and u are able to feel it, express it, say it, act it, demand it - And its been told its soooo easy for Allah to grant all of our wishes - but why do we feel AND believe Allah ignored it? Well, did we REALLY bother to learn how to check and look at the 'mailbox' or did we became too busy/ too comfortable at demanding it, and too comfortable at being in a poor state of mind?

We have a physical self & spiritual self.... What u mentioned about what the body feels are all physical, and u are hoping for the spiritual thing right?  Understand this first, we take care of our body by showering everyday or wudhu, eat nutrients food, exercise, plaster our skin cuts, refrain self-harm, etc... and what about how to take care of our soul? Did we put the same effort to our soul? Did we put the QUALITY effort to our soul? Like we can't eat Maggi everyday just to fill our stomach even when we're poor, We HAVE TO eat veggie and enough protein everyday. Praying 5 times a day and zikir all night can means bad when you're only doing it for the sake of religion rules, and not because how you love Allah. You don't have to be so quick on blaming yourself, you only need to realize whats wrong and act quick to find how to make it better - that is enough to make you eventually get out of bad cycle, get out from being comfortable in condemning anything.

Now back to that Prophet Musa story. The spiritual experience received can never be possible to explain to another human in this world. Human body use body language, words and sounds to deliver message... and what does soul can use for delivering message? not a letter, word and sound. its when you know, you know. Something that special can only be contained by you and Allah. Please never give up looking for it. You are smart. You had been asking all the brilliant questions, I'm sure you are getting closer and you will find it."
">“Dia tak takut ke masuk neraka?” one of them commented.

I suppose the best reply will be ""fitnah and umpatan juga dosa yg mungkin akan masuk neraka?""

Suicide is no joke, I have gone through divorce because we had some kind of post-partum depression leading to suicide attempt that almost succeeded..  after that, I was living through dark numbness in my head for years. Only through therapy that I've started to learn to deal with it. Depression may never be cured, we just learn coping mechanisms to deal with it so that we can still be reasonably functional in life. At times, we still fall back into the dark hole and go through days or weeks of life feeling utterly numb and cold.

Regarding your friend, I guess the best support you can give is to be there for her without being judgemental, just be a good listener as you are probably not a trained professional to provide any good advice to help her. If she really gets worse, then it is best to seek a real mental health professional."
Haram 100%. In Islam you go to hell for it.
"I find that the answer that 'god presence is there but you gotta feel it in with different senses' or that you have to focus hard enough only you will feel it is not a good answer.

First things first, god is allegedly omnipotent. If he is omnipotent it means he can make himself known to be super duper obvious and whatever so called 'human limitation' is not relevant because in his power, he can do anything; including making himself known to be super obvious which will not be limited by 'human limitations'.

Secondly, if i ask a beggar on the street what is his name, he can answer it clearly and very obvious to my senses. Yet for god, i have to do this do that all just to try to sense some obscure voice? Is the voice of god inferior compared to a beggar? Plus god claim he is close to me and love me; ''nearer to me than my jugular vein'' but somehow a beggar on the street whom i have never met my entire life and doesn't care a shit about me speaks to me in voice that is clearer than this so called personal god.

All the things you say is nothing new to me. I have spend years trying to psycho myself and giving all these mental gymnastics as a coping mechanism but enough is enough. If god has something to say, he can speak to me clearer than a beggar on the street. If not, he either don't care or not all powerful."
"what you said is true, and i am not the best at explaining things, but you are not being realistic and ignorant to what you have and feels. What i explained earlier are only the tools and method that you can make use to polish. Like a house window that needs to be clean regularly so you can have a real time view of this world. but you are so readily set believing whatever that you are seeing now is all there is. and like a helpless infant, you want things to work like magic for you just because God is omnipotent. God's presence is already in you. Before you wanted him to speak to you, he already speak to you. You walk to him, He runs to you. and you wondering why you hear nothing. Its obvious you still need to learn. That beggar who is talking to you is god. That yearning you have in you is god. Nothing exist and moves other than god. That is the truth written in the ugliest sentence.

Doesn't make sense you want to hear a song but doesn't go to work, get a salary, get a speaker, get an internet, and only then you can press play on any song you want... here in this world, not have to wait for the reward in after the world. Theres a reason why human is the best creature among all.

That is all. I don't wish to reply anymore. I hope this doesn't hurt you further and I wish you the best in life."
"I am being realistic. Is it not realistic to have high expectations of an omnipotent god, especially one that says:

>Your Lord has proclaimed, “Call upon Me, I will respond to you  
>  
>[https://quran.com/en/ghafir/60](https://quran.com/en/ghafir/60)  
>  
>Who responds to the distressed when they cry to Him, relieving ?their? affliction  
>  
>[Surah An-Naml - 1-93 - Quran.com](https://quran.com/27?startingVerse=62)

In the real world, if there is an advertisement who says one thing but fail to deliver, it is called false advertising.

In the real world, in an written contract/agreement, if the person fails to follow through with what was agreed upon by quoting some obscure word/sentence on some random clause hidden somewhere, it is called exploiting a loophole.

You might wanna watch this. This is an islamic professor in UK who faced this kinda depression and after having an internal debate within himself, he left religion. Same like me. I know you won't watch it. But if one day you continue to face the toxic loophole that i mentioned and things don't get better, remember this video and maybe you would watch it. Perhaps it can finally relieve you.

"People say its wrong but idk not everyone will get the same chance of help/being lucky to have some stuff that help their fucked up situations (like money or being born from hated nationality) so you end up with resistance and deal with all shit. 

 I found I can enjoy my time even with shitty stuff in my life, and yeah sometimes animal have more support than 90% of humans. 

probably we just need to be patient and not take the life too seriously."

You can acknowledge the courage required while still condemning an act :)
It takes much more courage to go through with life.

Okay, that was a nice attempt by Abbasids to develop psychology, but in modern psychology now all these have been considered obsolete anyway..."
Non here. Who cares. It's their life so it's up to them to decide what to do with it. As long as they don't jump from a high rise and end up hitting someone else or someone else stuffs with it then be my guest.

I wouldn't worry too much - heaven and hell are just made up concepts used to control people who aren't too bright.
On the plus side... that's all just made up.
">with no access to education, logic or science.

lmao have you heard of Islamic Golden age?"
"How about for those people who say that non-muslims will go to hell? Is that syirik as well? Cuz if it is, it is odd. Even quran says non-muslims will go to hell"
" “Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent.  
Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent.  
Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil?

Brutal but true. lol. Not that I would teach this to my kids.
"Muslim by IC.

I don't immediately go, ""nanti masuk neraka"", but I acknowledge that many do. Highly likely due to school teaching but I think it's also partly due to lack of real empathy & critical thinking. Think of it as something similar to ""sebab tuhan buat langit warna biru"" or ""sebab dah tertulis kat luh mahfuz""."
Thank you for being a kind soul.

"The al-Quran is the transcription of the revelations of Allah SWT by the Prophet PBUH, a creation of God himself, revised by Islamic clerics throughout its history. Despite the word of Allah that cannot be changed by ruling, however, it can be misinterpreted or even modifed to an extent. We cannot guarantee that the version of the Quran existing today is the same as the copy that Prophet Muhammad himself has written down despite rigorously verified. Political factors have resulted in how many different sects of belief in Islam in the modern world exists, perhaps changes in the Quran itself.

Back to your question, what is the term used in the Quran for 'non-Muslims' in your question? In Allah's context, are you really certain Allah's words referred to 'non-Muslims' or a subgroup who defies and defiles his teachings to be compassionate and decent beings? We are never certain. In today's world, someone seemingly pious, robed in white and dressed as that commanded in the Sunnah, csn also rape their daughter. They are munafik. A non-Muslim can do what a Muslim should do and be kind and compassionate to the poor and the destitute. Allah mandated solats to not remind us about fear of Allah, Allah mandated solat to remind us about his teachings to be compassionate and respected people.

I believe that those who say so are absolutely syirik. When you miscontrue Allah's words and use them against benign people (those who mean you or society no harm) to spread hate and fear, you are nothing but syirik, playing God and deciding their fates without knowledge of their deeds as what Allah knows. As what we know commonly, 

Allah Maha Penyayang
Allah Maha Adil
Allah Maha Pengampun
Allah Maha Mengetahui


We are all sinners. Only Allah SWT will decide our fate."
Don't care. The religion has caused so much brainrot.
"Alhamdulillah. I am okay for now. Living well, and physically healthy."
"That the onus is to disprove the existence of divinity; of heaven and hell and afterlife, instead of being to *prove* said existence, is very simply stupid, as it is beginning an argument that presupposes utterly flawed principles. You are deriving statements based on god's existence as an axiomatic truth.

I see not why it is upon anyone to prove that god, or a god, doesn't exist. Instead, it's for you to prove god exists.

Your belief that there exists such a thing as a god has its basis in *faith*.

Those who do not believe such a thing exists are not holding beliefs. The notion that ""god does not exist"" is not so much a belief as it is a logical truth. When someone claims that something exists, the burden of proof lies on that someone to demonstrate that claim. It doesn't lie on others to demonstrate the nonexistence of that something.

Essentially, what I'm saying is that it is pointless to even begin debating any of your arguments as to do so would first require the assumption that such a thing as a god exists to be fundamentally true; when that assumption is infinitely problematic, paradoxical, and downright impossible to work with from first principles."
I feel like doing it now.
